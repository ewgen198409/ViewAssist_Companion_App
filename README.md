This is an Android application and Home Assistant integration to compliment the amazing [View Assist project by @dinki](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist). It has been built from the ground up to simplify the setup of devices when using View Assist and provide a lower barrier to entry than other solutions.

Combining an Android application and a Home Assistant integration (to control your device), this solution offers:

- Voice support for HA voice assistants with on device wake word
- Browser functionality to display your HA dashboards on your device
- A media player to play your favourite music / radio station from HA
- A comprehensive set of controls & sensor entities to use in your automations and dashboards
