**The easiest way to build your own smart display with View Assist and Home Assistant!**

View Assist Companion App (or VACA for short) is an Android application and Home Assistant integration, designed to turn your old Android device into a Home Assistant integrated, voice controlled smart display!  Along with the amazing [View Assist project by @dinki](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist), you can make your own Alexa Show or Google Home replacement.

Extending the already amazing voice capabilities of Home Assistant, you can now have more than just voice devices.  You can have a fully functioning voice enabled smart display with...
- Built in wake word detection (no need to setup openwakeword in your HA environment) with 6 built-in options and the ability to add your own custom wake words
- Straight forward integration to HA Voice assistants (no additional configuration needed and you can choose which Voice Assistant to use for each device)
- Browser display to show your HA dashboards (and View Assist views)
- A media player to play your favourite music / radio station from Home Assistant
- Many built in controls for your device (screen on/off, brightness, dark mode, dnd, mic mute and more)
- Built in sensors for your device (battery level, charging, light level, orientation, last command, last response and more)
- Motion detection for camera enabled devices

It has been built from the ground up to make the first steps into making your own smart display quick and simple but also allow you to progress to much more advanced functionality as you grow.
